# leaflet-challenge

This repository contains my Leaflet submission for the Module 15 Assignment of the UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp. 

## Notes
- Please run the index.html file to launch the map showing earthquake data.
- Please see the logic.js file to review my code used in the map.
- I worked with classmate Portia Pray, TAs during class, and a tutor during a tutoring session to troubleshoot functions and the legend.
